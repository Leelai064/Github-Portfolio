## Portofolio Information

This portoflio showcases all of the applications that Leelai has created throughthe LPS Pen Web-Development Program. Over the 6 month period, React.js was taught and to showcase that knowledge we were challenged to replicate our vanilla JS, HTML, CSS portfolio in React.js format. I hope to further stylize this portfolio and iterate it further now that my handle on the vanilla code has imporved grately.
